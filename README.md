# Sofware-Design-Document
The Gaming Room was a client who wanted me to design a way for their game, Draw It or Lose It, to be developed for web based play. 

I felt that I did particularly well with the executive summary, the design constraints, system architecture, and domain model. While I didn't answer everything perfectly, I felt it was the area I had the most understanding in.

I found that working through a design document helped understand what the code was meant to do while working through the actual code. Pseudocode and flow charts can have a similar effect, but a design document helps really narrow down the idea of what the code is meant to do, especially when a client has a fairly specific idea of what they want their program to do.

I would probably revise the Recommendations section. I think that I misunderstood a good amount of the questions when I was going through and answering most of them. In future I would read them more cawrefully and ensure that I am answering the questions and making suggestions based on what the client wants more clearly.

I tried to read what the client wanted clearly and implemented my best understanding of it into the software design. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because the ultimately whether a user can easily utilize the software put in front of them determines whether or not it is well designed.

As far as designing software, I find keeping it simple is the best way to go. Making sure the software is not only easy to use for the user, but also is easy to read for other software developers is essential.
